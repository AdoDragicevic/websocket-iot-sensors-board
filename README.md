### Reflection

Working on this app was really fun! I never worked with websockets, and the project provided great practice for implementing optimization tools in react. I will sincirelly welcome any feedback you would be so kind to provide, and would be very glad to have a discussion on the alternative approaches you would suggest. Thank you.
